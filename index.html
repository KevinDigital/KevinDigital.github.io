        <p>This is a picture of me (Kevin Li) when I was in Paris, Winter of 2015.</p>
        
        <p>My name is Kevin Li and I am a Cornell student studying Computer Science. I like a lot of the computer science courses that I've taken so far. Other than this class, I've taken Python, Java, Discrete Structures, and Computer System Organization. I'm expected to graduate in 2019. At the top are some of my professional profiles in case anyone is interested.</p>
